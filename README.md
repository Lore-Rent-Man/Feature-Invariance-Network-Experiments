# Feature-Invariance-Network-Experiments

A series of experiments during the Neuroscience and Engineering course to try to further improve performance on the existing model known as CorRelNet. CorRelNet was a network specifically designed to tackle relational tasks for the image modality. By extending the tasks to include audio modality as well as additional invariances (rotation, translation, hue), we were able to improve upon aspects of the model that enabled better learning of feature invariances in specific tasks that the initial model had failed upon. Techniques like grad-cam were super helpful for our team to conjure up ideas on how to improve the performance of the base model without losing its powerful generalization.
